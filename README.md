# 🧠 Quera Algorithm Challenges

This repository contains my solutions and implementations for algorithmic and programming challenges from [quera.org](https://quera.org/).  
It’s a collection of problem-solving exercises written in various programming languages, focusing on data structures, algorithms, and computational thinking.

## 📚 Contents

- 🔢 **Mathematical & Number Theory Problems**
- 🧮 **Data Structures (arrays, stacks, queues, trees, graphs)**
- 🚀 **Algorithmic Challenges (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.)**
- 🧩 **Coding Competitions & Quera Contests**

Each challenge folder typically includes:
```

problem_name/
├── problem_description.md
├── solution

````
