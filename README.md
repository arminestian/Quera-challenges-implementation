# 🧠 Quera Algorithm Challenges

This repository contains my solutions and implementations for algorithmic and programming challenges from [quera.org](https://quera.org/).
It’s a collection of problem-solving exercises written in various programming languages, focusing on data structures, algorithms, and computational thinking.

## 📚 Contents

* 🔢 **Mathematical & Number Theory Problems**
* 🧮 **Data Structures (arrays, stacks, queues, trees, graphs)**
* 🚀 **Algorithmic Challenges (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.)**
* 🧩 **Coding Competitions & Quera Contests**

Each challenge folder typically includes:

```
problem_name/
├── problem_description.txt
├── solution.py
└── README.md
```

## 🧰 Technologies Used

Depending on the challenge, solutions may be implemented in:

* 🐍 Python
* ☕ Java
* 💻 C++
* 🦀 Rust *(coming soon)*


## 🚧 Repository Goals

* Improve algorithmic problem-solving skills
* Practice clean, efficient, and readable code
* Build a reference collection for students and developers solving Quera challenges


## 🤝 Contributions

Feel free to:

* Open issues for suggestions or corrections
* Submit pull requests with improved or alternative solutions
* Discuss algorithmic approaches in the issues section
