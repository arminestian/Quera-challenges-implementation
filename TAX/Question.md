The amount of income tax imposed on any taxpayer depends on his/her income. For an income less than or equal to  
1,000,000 Oshloobs, no tax is paid. For an income greater than  
1,000,000 and less than or equal to  
5,000,000 Oshloobs, the tax is  
10% of the income. For an income over  
5,000,000 Oshloobs, the tax is  
20% of the income. You should write a program to calculate the net income of any given employee after the deducted tax.
