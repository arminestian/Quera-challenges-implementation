# Factorial Calculation

**Time limit:** 1 second
**Memory limit:** 50 MB

Write a program that reads an integer `n` and calculates its **factorial**.

The factorial of a number `n`, denoted by `n!`, is the product of all positive integers from `1` to `n`.
In other words:

[
n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * n
]

---

## Input

A single line containing one integer `n`.

### Constraints

```
1 ≤ n ≤ 10
```

---

## Output

Print the factorial of `n`.

---

## Example

### Sample Input 1

```
5
```

### Sample Output 1

```
120
```

Explanation:

[
5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120
]
